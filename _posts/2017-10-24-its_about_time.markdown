### I began dreaming of a career change

<p>I asked lots of people lots of questions.</p>
<p>One of those people suggested I play a game, yes, a game:  [Human Resource Machine](http://https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine) </p>
<p>I played it.</p>
<p>I loved it.</p>
<p>I asked lots more people lots more questions about coding and development.</p>
<p>I got lots of answers.</p>
<p>I dabled in a variety of courses on MATLAB, JavaScript, Python, and the [CS50: Intro to Computer Science](http://http://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science).</p>
<p>Done. I knew I wanted to be a computer wizard.</p>
<p>Lots and lots of research led me to Flatiron, and here I am. I couldn't be happier.</p>
