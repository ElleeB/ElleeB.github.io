### I began dreaming of a career change

<p>I asked lots of people lots of questions.
<p>One of those people suggested I play a game, yes, a game: 
[Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine)
<p>I played it.
<p>I loved it.
<p>I asked lots more people lots more questions about coding and development.
<p>I got lots of answers.
<p>I dabled in a variety of courses on MATLAB, JavaScript, Python, and Harvard's
[CS50: Intro to Computer Science](http://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science).
<p>Done. I knew I wanted to be a computer wizard.
<p>Lots and lots of research led me to Flatiron, and here I am. I couldn't be happier.
