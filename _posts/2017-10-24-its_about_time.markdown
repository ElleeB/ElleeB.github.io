## **How did I get here?**
For thirteen years I've taught digital art and design:
* Graphic Design

* Digital Media
* Animation
* Adobe Illustrator
* Photoshop
* InDesign
* Animate
* After Effects

### **I began dreaming of a career change**

I asked lots of people lots of questions.

One of those people suggested I play a game, yes, a game: <br></br>
[Human Resource Machine](https://tomorrowcorporation.com/humanresourcemachine).

I played it.

I loved it.

I asked lots more people lots more questions about coding and development.

I got lots of answers.

I dabled in a variety of courses on MATLAB, JavaScript, Python, and Harvard's <br></br>
[CS50: Intro to Computer Science](http://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science).

Done. I knew I wanted to be a computer wizard.

Lots and lots of research led me to Flatiron, and here I am. I couldn't be happier.
