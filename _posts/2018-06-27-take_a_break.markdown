Problem-solving and the creative process drew me to programming. I become immersed. Maybe I'm stubborn. I don't know when to stop and ask for help. Should I stop after two-hours of working on a line of code? Maybe aftera day-and-a-half of working on a method is too much (seems obvious, right?). Assuming this is common among programmers, I wonder how others overcome this almost detrimental determination.

While considering possible solutions, I thought about writer's and artist's block, so naturally, I consulted The Google. It looks like the term 'coder's block' is a well explored topic. What I experience doesn't always feel like a block, but a need for help in order to understand, but perhaps setting up a system that includes incorporating methods for avoiding a block will help. Once those steps are exhausted, it's time for me to ask for help.

1. Pen and Paper - Step away from the computer! Write and draw thoughts. Revisit.
2. Walk Away - Take a walk. Get physical, even if in short bursts. Revisit.
3. Work on Another Task - Pick up another project or coding problem for some time, or even the rest of the day. Revisit.
4. Still stuck? Ask for help!

I do wonder what this looks like in an environment where deadlines are very real. In my current world, deadlines are fluid and usually self-determined. I look forward to working with a team of people in my future, surrounded by mentors and others from whom I'll learn and find support.
